I am a CS Ph.D. student at USC, affiliated with the USC ISI MINDS group, and a former researcher at USC iLab. I have also worked at Georgia Tech’s Agile Systems Lab and Photonics Research Group.

My research focuses on VLMs, and multimodal learning, with current projects on adapting and aligning test-time foundation models.

My long-term goal is to develop efficient AGI to automate labor for EVERYONE and tackle humanity’s toughest engineering challenges, including quantum hardware design, aging and cancer solutions, and controllable fusion energy.
