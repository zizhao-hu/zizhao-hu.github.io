I am a Ph.D. student in CS at USC, affiliated with the USC ISI MINDS group.

My research interests include Generative Modeling(Diffusion Model, Consistency Model, GAN, VAE, etc..), Multimodal Learning, Meta-learning, and Life-long Learning. My current projects are related to new generative learning schemes with better temporal understanding, aiming to bridge the gap between AI and human intelligence. academicpages template

My long-term goal is to develop efficient and human-inspired machine learning models that have the potential to exceed general human intelligence and pave the way for AGI, which will serve as a general tool for speeding the development of physics, material design, quantum computing, solutions for aging & cancer, controllable fusion energy, etc..
